## ✍🏼 Description

According to the CONEVAL (Consejo Nacional de Evaluacion de la Politica de Desarrollo Social) found that 22.5% of the population in Mexico are at risk due to a lack of access of nutrititous good quality food.

FoodBank is an idea created as a tool to help the most vulnerable in our community. With the intent to bridge communities to food banks we have created FoodBank. It was thoughtout to be equitable to the community, intuite for its users and innovative for future development.

Using React, mongoDB, Chakra UI and the skills of a multitalented team we have created FoodBank.
